    "\n",
    "Identifying the number of accessible shared data its a more complicated task as it requires to actually link a data file with a publication. Data files can be distributed in many places and no-direct link between both assets is often provided. We are considering three approaches:\n",
    "\n",

    "Academic Publications would include notes of the data assets they use and where they are deposited for access. These depositions statements can be used to identify shared data.\n",

    "- Depositions statement are included in publications that use either experimental or modelling data.\n",
    "- Deposition statements are about data created by the authors.\n",

    "\n",
    "Academic Publications mention descriptions of the data they use and these descriptions are also used to name and describe files that contain the shared data. Terms in those descriptions and in the publications can be used to link shared data. For example in [#achcar_dynamic_2012] :\n",
