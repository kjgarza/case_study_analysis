3.1 Communication<br>Collaboration does not occur in a vacuum, and as such, communication plays an important role (Sclater et al. 2001). This is especially the case in virtual and distributed project teams (Qureshi et al. 2005). Communication can be considered essential for any group-undertaking as without it (in whichever format or medium it may occur) the message cannot be delivered with any accuracy.<br>The ability to communicate effectively is critical if information is to be shared and/or distributed. It has been described as the key that holds together a channel of distribution (Batt and Purchase 2004). It is not coincidental that communication appears as the primary element for collaboration (and is implicit in the understand- ing of the other terms – coordination and cooperation). Open and frequent com- munication is considered to be a critical factor that can influence the success of collaboration, as is the importance of establishing informal relationships and communication links (Mattessich et al. 2001).<br>However, the number of channel options available to the project team may affect the quality of the communication. The variety of channels include telephone (land line and mobile), fax, voice mail and email – add the OCT to this suite, and the research environment requires discipline to ensure the most suitable medium is used at the most suitable time, even to the extent of team members foregoing communication by other media for specific types of information (O’Brien 2000). Communication is crucial in these channels, where it can serve as an ideal process by which persuasive information is transmitted, participative decision-making is fostered, programs are coordinated, power is exercised and commitment and loyalty are encouraged (Batt and Purchase 2004).<br>There are instances that can lead to problems occurring with communication, for example social barriers, where the lack of experience working within a collective environment can present other problems (Sclater et al. 2001), or where there is a lack of communication skills which affects the manner and effectiveness of collab- oration (Bharadwaj et al. 2004). These problems are barriers to communication and can be due to issues such as not knowing the collaborators in advance, not having clearly defined roles and responsibilities, misunderstandings between members and conflicting institutional or organisational cultures (Sclater et al. 2001).<br>The ability to effectively communicate across the research project is inextricably linked not only to the content and motivation behind the desire to disseminate the information, but to the management of the collaborative environment itself (Davenport et al. 1998). Without the capability to communicate, it is difficult to manage the expectations of others, and the collaborative environment. This has a flow-on effect in the fulfilment of trust and respect, and sharing information within the research environment.<br><br><br>3.2 Trust and Respect<br>It is important to gauge the level of trust and respect that may exist between the partners within the research environment (Austin 2000), as the notion of trust occupies a central position for practitioners involved in collaborative initiatives (Vangen and Huxham 2003). Trust is seen to be the essential intangible asset of collective alliances, the interpersonal webbing that knits organisations together and facilitates concerted effort. Trust is reciprocal, in that one has to give it in order to receive it, and is built step by step over time (Reina and Reina 2006). It is also one of the key areas of concern in maintaining a good relationship (Austin 2000; Batt and Purchase 2004) and effective communication (Qureshi et al. 2005).<br>Barnes et al. (2000) see trust as being an integral success factor for collaboration. Trust develops through active engagement and participation with others and the delicate fabric of human relationships (Reina and Reina 2006). The research environment provides an excellent situation in which these relationships can be tested, as it draws on various team members from different business units, partner- ing organisations or affiliated companies. The effective operation of the team will require an understanding of trust and respect, and the factors that may impact on its presence, including the team members’ perception of themselves, of other team members, and of other stakeholders involved with the project (Herzog 2001).<br>As has been noted for collaboration in general, there are many different forms of trust that can exist in the project, including contractual, competitive, goodwill, communicative, emotional and ethical trust. It is the combination of the different types of trust that influences collaborative levels of trust (Reina and Reina 2006).<br>Trust features in many organisational frameworks. This is because effective inter-firm links and associated learning between partners depend on high levels of trust (Davenport et al. 1998). In an inter-organisational environment, trust can become a major governance mechanism in that it facilitates coordination and collaboration and assists with knowledge sharing (Black et al. 2002).<br>Notions of trust, knowledge sharing and collaboration become central elements of inter-organisational relationships (Black et al. 2002; Vangen and Huxham 2003). These elements are particularly important for the research environment if inter- organisational relationships are to involve the mutual participation of people, and an element of cooperation, coordination or collaboration. Trust in this instance, is best understood in terms of the ability to form expectations about the aims and the partner’s future behaviour in relation to these aims. A necessary condition for trust is that expectations can be formed on the one hand, and fulfilled on the other (Vangen and Huxham 2003). Trust has also been shown to play a major role in the effectiveness of information sharing and organisational learning, and in knowledge and information sharing in inter-organisational relationships (Black et al. 2002). Of note however, is that cooperation does not require trust, and it may be induced by coercion; even though trust is considered vital to bringing about increased cooper- ative processes.<br>Much has been written about the development of trust building and the mechan- isms for maintaining trust. For our purposes, it is sufficient to say that trust remains a core element within the application of the three terms of cooperation, coordination and collaboration.<br><br><br>3.3 Equality and Power<br>Even when attention is paid to the research environment and the management of trust within relationships, the inherent fragility of the trust loop is evident. Along- side the issues relating to the dynamic nature of collaboration, power issues in particular have the capacity to affect this loop (Vangen and Huxham 2003). Power in collaboration lies not in controlling the behaviour of individuals, but rather in creating a situation that constrains or enables individuals (Walker 2003). Collaboration involves both aligning the economic goals of the network and the development of the social dimensions. Power is an essential characteristic of social organisations and an inevitable instrument for organisational coordination (Batt and Purchase 2004). It entails parties being able to understand the relationship so that their own interests can be articulated clearly in order to function within the operating environment (Walker 2003).<br>A paradox of collaboration is whilst the process of collaboration creates depen- dency between the partners; inevitably some will be more central to the enactment of the collaborative agenda than others. This frequently leads to perceptions about power imbalances between those viewed as principal versus those viewed as subsidiary members (Vangen and Huxham 2003).<br>Power in collaboration is typically fragmented, yet teams can achieve collabo- rative advantage by finding ways to ensure shared power is maximised. The way in which parties negotiate their positions of power and equality within their environ- ment leads to the fulfilment of an effective partnership and strategic alliance. And while it is inevitable that the collaborative partners may have unequal power bases,the assumption is that all collaborative participants will be, and should be, equal within the confines of the collaborative project (Walker 2003).<br>Technology has the capacity to enable information sharing, but it is dependent upon people in teams wanting to share their information with others. One rea- son given for people’s unwillingness to share information is that information is linked to power and money (Barua et al. 1997), while another suggests that even in collaborative environments, people are uncomfortable giving power away (O’Brien 2000).<br><br><br>3.4 Strategic Alliances<br>Firms and organisations do not operate in isolation but must seek to collaborate with other organisations and within other networks in order to achieve their goals and desired outcomes. Networks have risen to prominence due to industrial restruc- turing, large scale downsizing, vertical disaggregation and outsourcing, and the elimination of management layers. Replacing them are leaner, more flexible firms focused on core technology and processes. These firms are closely aligned in a network of strategic alliances and partnerships with customers, suppliers, distribu- tors and competitors (Batt and Purchase 2004). This network is evident across the contemporary research environment, which often shows input from several special- ist firms or affiliated suppliers/contributors.<br>The strategic alliance contains relationships between two or more suppliers that are servicing the same customer base, and are thus partners in a horizontal association. The driving force initially behind the alliance includes cost savings, greater efficien- cies, synergy, critical mass, stability, and/or competitive advantage (Lendrum 1998).<br>Collaboration is closely tied to the key characteristics of strategic alliances (Yoshino and Rangan 1995). The first characteristic of a strategic alliance entails the participating organisations pursuing a set of common goals, and remaining independent subsequent to the formation of the alliances. The second characteristic involves the partnering organisations sharing the benefits of the alliances and control over the performance of the tasks or activities. The third characteristic is where the partnering organisations continue to contribute in one or more key strategic areas.<br>A firm’s position in the alliance or network will depend on the nature of the direct and indirect relationships it has with other players in the network, the nature of the project, and the associated structures that contribute to the delivery of the outputs. It is determined by the different types of research environments possible within a collaborative network and the organisational structures that are in place to manage these. Each of these environments, including research, project manage- ment, and government to name a few, would have a different requirement for their project team relationships and role of their strategic alliance partners.<br>The commitment members give to the partnership is crucial in ensuring that the relationship can sustain the project timelines. Other factors to consider when reviewing the strategic alliance are whether the partners understand the level of commitment required, what are their expectations and whether these are commen- surate with execution capabilities and their competency in the area, and if the alliance is considered to be managed properly (Austin 2000; Davenport et al. 1998).<br>|<b><font color='#FF0000'>&lt&lt transmutationalPurpose</font></b>|Ultimately, however, the players or partners within these projects are contribut- ing to a shared or common business objective, or have an incentive for their participation.|<u><font color='#FF0000'><i>transmutationalPurpose &gt&gt</font></u></i>| They share a stake in both the process and the outcome, have multiple layers of participation, and are flexible regarding the process and structure of the collaboration (Mattessich et al. 2001).<br><br><br>3.5 Incentive and Value<br>For the collaborative partnership to work, partners need to invest. It is important for members to perceive the collaboration as in their self-interest (Mattessich et al. 2001), even though the purpose of the partnership is to have a shared vision with attainable goals and objectives.<br>The creation of value is therefore an element that facilitates the return on investment for the participating partners. Partners may be looking at the research environment to identify certain areas where value can be achieved as an incentive to participate; for example team-based rewards provided in anticipation of a return in better teamwork (Barua et al. 1997). Partners may choose to identify specific benefits that may flow out of the collaboration, |<b><font color='#FF0000'>&lt&lt transmutationalPurpose</font></b>|consider whether social value can be generated from it, and if there are new resources, capabilities or benefits that are being created as a result of the collaboration (Austin 2000).|<u><font color='#FF0000'><i>transmutationalPurpose &gt&gt</font></u></i>|<br>Reciprocal behavior within the relationship also emerges from a perceived self- interest in a world of permanence and trust, where a team provides information needed by another in anticipation of receiving a similar favor in the future (Barua et al. 1997). This suggests that concepts of incentive and value are closely asso- ciated with the type of partnerships or “collaborative” environments that can occur, as well as the expected returns for this engagement. A shared incentive may also decrease the number or severity of disputes, as there is a mutual financial impera- tive to complete the project.<br><br><br>3.6 Negotiation<br>Collaboration requires a degree of negotiation to occur between the participating partners so they can come to an understanding of the terms of conditions and rules of engagement of their relationship. These negotiations assist in drafting and creating a consensus on operating factors such as the roles and responsibilities of the partners. These negotiations can, however, be made complex when there is no legitimate authority present to manage the situation and where power and politics become mission critical elements. |<b><font color='#FF0000'>&lt&lt membership</font></b>|Participants can remain relatively autonomous within the network, and may need to be convinced to act on their own volition, as there is no legitimate authority that can demand cooperation (Phillips et al. 1998).|<u><font color='#FF0000'><i>membership &gt&gt</font></u></i>| Negotiations can be undertaken in a variety of ways. They can be fluid or in a structured environment, be influenced by market and authority-based relationships, or can be based on autonomous participation (Phillips et al. 1998; Walker 2003).<br>|<b><font color='#FF0000'>&lt&lt organisation</font></b>|Ultimately, in order for a research project to survive, partners must embrace a notion of collaboration, one that includes a collective strategy in which organisa- tions cooperate rather than compete, and can compromise when required (Mattessich et al. 2001; Phillips et al. 1998).<br>|<u><font color='#FF0000'><i>organisation &gt&gt</font></u></i>|<br><br>3.7 Inter-organisational Knowledge Sharing<br>Knowledge is a vital resource in project-based industries. In order for collaboration strategies to occur, partners should be willing to both distribute knowledge to other members and integrate knowledge made available to them (Halme 2001). This task presents new and challenging processes for the electronic research environment (van Donk and Reizebos 2005).<br>Advanced I.T. has prompted many organisations to invest in distributed computing systems and to decentralise the management of information. Yet while decentralised and distributed information management may result in gathering high-quality infor- mation, there is a risk that this information emerges in isolation rather than being shared across the project.<br>For this reason, the role of the information system within a collaborative environment can be to create linkages among sub-units through the development of appropriate policies, guidelines and standards. Today’s research organisation requires an effective information-exchange to bridge information gaps between different decision-makers or teams controlling specific information or data sets, and to share resources to achieve project deliverables (Romano et al. 2002).<br>Inter-organisational collaboration has the capacity to improve strategic perfor- mance in a number of areas within the project, by helping to spread risk, share resources, enhance flexibility, increase access to technological know-how and information, and provide formal and informal communication links (Mattessich et al. 2001; Phillips et al. 1998).<br>Knowledge developed in projects and subsequently distributed among project participants provides a vital mechanism for the eResearch environment, allowing multi-project organisations to support decisions on a variety of fronts including resourcing and skills development (van Donk and Reizebos 2005).<br>Knowledge sharing in projects will include explicit as well as tacit and embed- ded forms, the latter expressed in actions, procedures and/or artefacts (Katzy et al. 2000). These are likely to vary considerably across different project environments or work scenarios and are much more difficult to transfer. Tacit or embedded knowledge cannot be separated from the work culture and the social construction of the work processes in each organisation, and as such is inextricably linked to the culture of the research environment and the associated relationships. Explicit knowledge transferral can be understood by reviewing and analysing communica- tion patterns within the organisation, while implicit knowledge transfer needs to be judged by how the knowledge is applied (Katzy et al. 2000).<br>Knowledge can be distinguished as something that is possessed by either an individual or a group. It may also be viewed as an organisational-level phenomenon, embedded in organisational forms, social expertise, and as “knowledge-in-practice” situated in the historical, socio-material and cultural context in which it occurs (Black et al. 2002). The factors that influence whether, and how effectively, knowledge is shared may also include experience, trust, motivation and the level of difficulty experienced when actually engaging in the knowledge transfer (Binz-Scharf 2005).<br>The authors, van Donk and Reizebos (2005), identify three main aspects of knowledge in project-based organisations. The first is entrepreneurial, and includes the knowledge that pertains to acquisitions within the research environment. The second aspect is technical, which is limited to the technology applied to the project, and includes the technical sense of the project. The third aspect embraces the project management knowledge. This aspect combines the theoretical knowledge on project management, which may include associated techniques, with the real experience in conducting and managing the project (van Donk and Reizebos 2005). Given that much of the information contained within these three aspects is also likely to be distributed amongst several project teams, it is critical that these types of knowledge are effectively distributed and shared across the research environ- ment. Failure to do so could result in risking the delivery of the key result areas or outcomes of the project. This can also lead to tension within the project environ- ment, where problems with information sharing can be attributed to the divergence in goals and objectives of different teams within the research environment, or to a symptom of an ineffective partnership (Barua et al. 1997; Binz-Scharf 2005).<br>Importantly, the research team requires a consistency of members and partners to ensure strong interpersonal bonds are maintained and information sharing con- tinues across the environment (Austin 2000). This sharing environment can be threatened by outside forces, including the perception of non-permanence or per- manence of interactions between the teams, disparities in information processing capabilities and rewards systems, and inefficient information-sharing behaviour from both the individual and organisational perspective (Barua et al. 1997). In these instances, mutual trust is a necessary condition for any successful knowledge- sharing environment (van Donk and Reizebos 2005).<br><br>|NA
